# cs2-invuln

A simple Counter-Strike 2 plugin which could
 make player invulnerable (ignores all damage),
 built on the top of
[CounterStrikeSharp](https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp).

Usage: `!invuln` in game chat, requires `@css/cheats`
 permission.

This plugin was made as result of the research
about how to cancel damages taken by players,
 so it may introduce bad gameplay experience,
 **only for research purpose**.
